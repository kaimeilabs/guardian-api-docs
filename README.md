# Guardian Engine by Kaimei Labs - API & SDK

Welcome to the **Guardian Engine** public SDK and Agent Connection repository, built by **Kaimei Labs**.

> **Guardian is the symbolic verification layer for neuro-symbolic AI pipelines — catching recipe hallucinations before they reach the pan. LLMs generate, Guardian verifies.**

When AI agents generate recipes, they hallucinate. They set ovens to impossible temperatures, skip the Maillard reaction, substitute ingredients that break emulsions, and produce dishes that fail in the real kitchen. Guardian Engine models each recipe as a **directed acyclic graph (DAG)** of culinary state transformations — verifying temperatures, durations, techniques, and ingredient interactions against curated master recipes from professional kitchens. The result: a strict authenticity and physics verification score (0–100%).

## Connecting Your Agent (MCP)

Guardian provides a native **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** server via HTTPS. No API key required. By connecting your agent via MCP, it will automatically gain access to tools like `verify_recipe` and `list_dishes`.

> *Free during early access. No API key required. Fair use applies — see our [terms](https://kaimeilabs.dev/terms) for details.*

**Endpoint URL**: `https://api.kaimeilabs.dev/mcp`
**Transport**: Streamable HTTP (`mcp.client.streamable_http`)

### Quickstart

1. Ensure you have Python 3.10+ installed.
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the live integration test to confirm connection to the public API:
   ```bash
   python test_integration.py
   ```
4. Check out `client.py` to see how to pass a structured recipe payload for verification.

### Custom Agents (LangChain, LlamaIndex, etc.)
If you are building a custom agent, connect directly to the public endpoint using the official Python MCP SDK. See `client.py` for a minimal example, or `test_integration.py` for a full integration test.

## 🍳 Available Verification Targets

Guardian can currently verify AI-generated recipes against **15 master recipes** spanning 10 cuisines. Each master recipe encodes the physics constraints (temperatures, durations, techniques, required ingredients) that define an authentic version of the dish.

| Cuisine | Dishes |
|---------|--------|
| **French** | Confit de Canard · Cheese Soufflé · Crème Brûlée · French Onion Soup |
| **Chinese** | Kung Pao Chicken · Cantonese Steamed Fish |
| **Indonesian** | Beef Rendang |
| **British** | Beef Wellington |
| **Italian** | Pasta Carbonara |
| **Spanish** | Basque Cheesecake |
| **American** | Southern Fried Chicken · Texas Smoked Brisket |
| **Peruvian** | Ceviche |
| **European** | Florentine Biscuits |
| **Universal** | Roast Chicken |

> 📌 New recipes are added regularly. Use the `list_dishes` tool to always get the current catalog from the live API.

> 💡 **Try it:** Ask your AI agent to generate a Beef Rendang recipe, then pass it to `verify_recipe` — Guardian will catch hallucinated cooking mediums, missing required ingredients, and incorrect state transformations.

## 📊 Data & Privacy

- **No PII collected** — we do not store user names, emails, or API keys in our application logs. Underlying cloud infrastructure may temporarily process IP addresses for routing and security.
- **Data for Compute Exchange** — the free early-access Service is provided in exchange for usage data. Submitted recipes are used to train models, improve verification accuracy, and create derived datasets. All external data products are anonymized. See our [Terms of Service](https://kaimeilabs.dev/terms) for full details.
- **Do not include PII** in your recipe payloads (e.g., author names, email addresses). You are responsible for ensuring submitted content is free of personal data.
- Fair use quotas enforced via compute limits during early access.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer**: Guardian verification results, including safety-related findings such as cooking temperatures and allergen warnings, are automated and informational only. They should not be relied upon as professional food safety, health, or culinary advice.
